    <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <p>I was born in Tulsa, OK on 8/25/1994 and currently live in Tulsa as well. I currently work two jobs, at Amazon and Hillcrest
          Medical Center. When I'm not working, I like to play games, read, watch anime, shop, spend time with family
          and friends, watch ASMR and more! I have 1 sibling, and through him, I have 4 beautiful nieces who are my pride and joy.
          They are the closest thing to children that I have, as I don't have any of my own. I have
          included a picture of each below, aren't they adorable?! <br></p>

        <h2>Work Experience/Goals</h2>
        <p><b>As of right now, I currently work two jobs. I have been working part-time at Amazon since August 2021. 
          I work for the PFSD (Prime for Same Day) team at DOK2 Tulsa. Our team is super amazing and currently holds the
          record for most days with On Time Dispatch for our region (17 days), which consists of Colorado/Texas/Oklahoma. 
          I work overnight, full-time at Hillcrest Medical Center as a PBX Operator. With that, I answer calls from outside and within the hospital, 
          I run emergency codes and do some general computer/office work as well. I have been here since December 2019.
          One of my main goals for right now, is to go from having two jobs to one job in my field of interest. 
          I hope that this course, and potentially finishing my degree in CS, will elevate that pursuit as well. 
          While Software Development is the major pursuit career wise, I have also considered such fields as Cybersecurity and Video Game Development as well. 
          Whatever path that I take, I hope that it's one that I will enjoy and experience longevity and endless learning. 
          It would be unhonest of me to not mention my hopes of a career that will pay off financially. 
          Such things as how tough things are today and my background/upbringing fuel this hope. </b></p>
      
        <h2>Education/Achievements</h2>
        <p> I graduated from a little charter school named Dove Science Academy in 2012. After I graduated from high school,
         I went on to attend Tulsa Community College, where I graduated with an A.S. in Mathematics in 2015.  
         After that, I transferred to Northeastern State University from 2015-2016, but stopped attending after Spring 2016. 
         I took a hiatus for a couple of years, where I mainly worked full-time and took care of my parents and brother. 
         I decided to go back to school in 2018 and applied to Oklahoma State University for the Spring 2019 semester.  
         This is where I decided to change my major to Computer Science. I changed my major because I was so interested in working with computers and technology and wanted to go into a field that would ensure that. 
         I currently have a couple of courses left before I graduate with my Bachelor's and I plan to finish in the Spring.
         Another thing that I consider an achievement was discovering and applying for this program. I know that it's just
         the second week, but I'm enjoying the experience and everything that we've learned so far.</p>
